# systemtap

SystemTap syntax highlighting support and auto completion.


## Known issues

Because of upstream issuse ([microsoft/vscode#64966](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/34525) & [atom/language-c#146](https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues/146)), use C++ syntax highlight for embedded C code.
